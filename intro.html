    <h2>What are Courtyard Homes?</h2>
    <p>Courtyard homes are architectural marvels that blend functionality, aesthetics, and sustainability, making them ideal for regions with warm climates. Designed around an open central courtyard, these homes promote natural light, ventilation, and an inviting connection to the outdoors.</p>

    <h2>The Heart of the Home: The Courtyard</h2>
    <p>The central courtyard is the heart of these homes, providing a natural airflow system that cools interiors passively. The courtyard serves as a social and communal space, where families can gather, relax, and celebrate. This open design maximizes cross-ventilation, allowing warm air to rise and escape, which is especially beneficial in tropical or hot climates. As a result, courtyard homes remain comfortably cool without the need for excessive air conditioning, reducing energy consumption.</p>

    <h2>Sustainability and Local Materials</h2>
    <p>A hallmark of courtyard homes is their use of locally sourced materials like wood, stone, and clay, which offer natural insulation and blend seamlessly with the environment. In regions like Kerala, India, traditional courtyard homes—such as the Nalukettu—are constructed from materials like laterite stone, timber, and clay tiles. These homes are thoughtfully designed to withstand seasonal changes, heavy rainfall, and high temperatures, making them both resilient and environmentally friendly.</p>

    <h2>Community and Nature</h2>
    <p>Beyond their architectural benefits, courtyard homes foster a sense of community and connection with nature. By centering around an open space, families are encouraged to spend time together in a serene, natural setting. Courtyard homes also support rainwater harvesting and groundwater recharge by directing rain into storage tanks or wells, emphasizing sustainability in water use.</p>
